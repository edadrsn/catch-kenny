Catch Kenny is an interactive Android game where players try to catch Kenny as he randomly appears on the screen. 
The game offers three different Kenny colors (Blue, Pink, and Orange), and the selected color determines the gameplay style.
Additionally, randomly appearing cat images add an extra challengeâ€”tapping a cat decreases the score.

2-Tap Kenny whenever he appears on the screen to earn points.
3-Be careful! Tapping the cat will decrease your score.
4-Try to get the highest score before the time runs out!
